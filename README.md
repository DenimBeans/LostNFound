Local Test Instructions

1.) Execute "npm install" in the Frontend and Backend folders

2.) Download .env from the Discord server, insert into the Backend folder (make sure the file is named ".env" and not "env" when you put it there!)

3.) Run "npm start" in the backend folder (This opens up a local server that connects to the database and allows you to connect with Postman)

4.) Run "npm run dev" in the frontend folder (This allows you to access the frontend locally)
